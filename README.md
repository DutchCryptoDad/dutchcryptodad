### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a regular Dutch dad with a passion for crypto, trading, technology and learning. This channel is my personal journey into the world of Crypto, blockchain, programming, trading bots, trading strategies, NFT's, Defi and many things more related to digital assets. I want to share my knowledge with others to help them as well in this vast world of digital assets. 

This is my github directory which contains code or other stuff for the following social media

# ANNOUNCEMENT
I am currently moving stuff around to make things easier to manage and also make a single point of reference to all content I create.
Therefore you may see stuff suddenly dissapear from this Github repository. But don't worry!

## Everything will be moved to my new website around algotrading with trading bots (and more): [dutchalgotrading.com](dutchalgotrading.com)
